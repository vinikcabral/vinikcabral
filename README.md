[**Labour Force & Social Protection Welfare in Ireland (Python)**](https://github.com/vinikcabral/Labour-Force-Social-Welfare-in-Ireland-PYTHON)<br>
This project explores how labour force participation and social protection interact to shape Ireland’s economic health. Using open data from the CSO and the Department of Social Protection, I applied Python for data cleaning, preparation, and visualization to uncover key patterns in employment, unemployment, and welfare policies.
